                Welcome to Energy Empire. Learn more about renewable and non-renewable energy through a fun and engaging board game. 
                Please familiarize with the rules down below before starting the game.
                <h2>Rules</h2>
                At the start of each turn:
                <ul>
                    <li> Random Events </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> At the start of each turn, 
                            draw a card from the random event deck.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Card effects may be positive or negative!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Income </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At the start of the each turn, collect $25,000 per MWh</li>
                        <li>Purchase or sell infrastructure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Happiness and Enviroment</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        1,000 MWh is normal (less than that is a -1 to happiness and less that 500 MWh is -3). 
                        Above 1500 MWh is a +1 to happiness. (2000+ MWh is +3 to happiness)
                     </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
